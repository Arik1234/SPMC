# Jarvis

As far as I'm concerned, Nvidia Shield has basically cornered the market, so is my main development device. More generally, Android TV devices, amlogic devices and Amazon FireTV *might* be getting some love ;)  
**Important: No more Rockchip specific support as of this version**

**Note 1:** As of 16.5.0, Android lollipop (API 21) is required  
**Note 2:** For recommendations and android voice search, SPMC must be already running.  

Latest Jarvis build is: **16.7.1** [link](https://github.com/koying/SPMC/releases/tag/16.7.1-spmc)
